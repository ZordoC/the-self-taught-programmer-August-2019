# The self taught programmer 


This is a begginer's book written by cory althoff ( all credits and rights reserved to him ), this repo is my answer to the proposed challenges within the book.

<br>

The reason I took on this journey is because despite the fact I have been using python for a while now , I never actually "learned" it , I just improved my way through , this works for many people,
but I fell in love with this language, it's power, easiness and readibility.

<br>

I also never programmed in with an OOP design and this book is a great indrotuctery to that paradigm of programming, that it's not commonly used in Data Science, since Data Scientist don't really 
program for deployment.

<br>

However I really want to learn and I want to know how to deploy stuff with efficiency , also if you want to build some sort of application it's always usefull to know how OOP paradigm works atleast 
, I may want to build an application , or better I might want to create a tetris or snake game to train an genetic machine learning algorithm to learn how to play the game by itself, I think OOP is 
very forgotten in Data Science , and this is why there is reputation that Data Scientists "normally" have "bad" written code, that's not efficient and reproducible. Well this is my attempt to not 
fall into the same mistakes of many. Having a strong base knowledge about the programming language you are using as well as programming paradigms is an **essential skill** every Data Scientist should
have. 


Any questions suggestions are welcomed.


 Disclaimer: The first chapters are of a very  basic level.
