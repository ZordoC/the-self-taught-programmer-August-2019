# The self taught programmer 

<br>
<br>


This is a begginer's book written by Cory Althoff (all credits and rights reserved to him), this repo is my answer to the proposed challenges within the book.

<br>

The reason I took on this journey is despite the fact I have been using python for a while now , I never actually "learned" it the right way , I just "made" my way through , this may  work for alot of people,.
I fell in love with this language, it's power, easiness and readibility, so obviously I want to master it ( I also believe it will be the future ! ).

<br>

I never programmed  with an OOP design and this book has a great introduction to  OOP programming, that it's not commonly used in Data Science, since Data Scientist don't really 
program for deployment.

<br>

However I really want to learn and I want to know how to deploy stuff with efficiency , also if you want to build some sort of application it's always usefull to know how OOP paradigm works atleast 
, I may want to build an application , or better I might want to create a tetris or snake game to train an genetic machine learning algorithm to learn how to play the game by itself!

<br>

 I think OOP is easily forgotten in Data Science , and this is why the reputation of Data Scientists for "bad code" , that's not efficient and reproducible.

<br> Well this is my attempt to not fall into the same mistakes of many. Having a strong base knowledge about the programming language you are using as well as programming paradigms is an **essential skill** every Data Scientist should
have. 


Any questions suggestions are welcomed.


 Disclaimer: The first chapters are of a very  basic level.
